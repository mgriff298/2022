# 2022 Wordle Solver

This is a program created to consistently and efficiently solve the wordle game. I used pandas, numpy and matplotlib while employing information theory in
order to create an efficient guessing algorithm. It was a fun side project to analyze a set of data and see how the code would perform on a daily basis.

The excel file included contains two sheets: a test list of 5 letter words in the english language (100 words), and another list of all
5 letter words in the english language (12972 words).

The python file can be used by running it and then following the prompts. You will have the option to use it and manually enter information, or automate
its performance.
